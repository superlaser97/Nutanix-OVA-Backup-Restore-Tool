```bash
# In VM selection menus
- Search by VM name: "/search_term" 
- Filter by project: "project:ProjectName"
- Filter by power state: "state:ON" or "state:OFF"
- Recently used VMs at top
```

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
```bash
# Enhanced error messages
- Specific suggestions for common issues

```

## üîß **Medium Complexity Enhancements**

### 6. **Save/Load Selection Sets**
```bash
# New feature: selection profiles
- Save commonly used VM selections as profiles
- Load profiles: "load:WebServers" or "load:DatabaseCluster"
- Share profiles between team members
- Profile metadata (created by, date, description)
```

### 7. **Backup Verification**
```bash
# Integrity checking
- Automatic checksum validation after download
- Test restore verification (mount check)
- Backup consistency reports
- Corruption detection and alerts
```

### 8. **Resume Interrupted Operations**
```bash
# Robustness improvements
- Save operation state to resume later
- Partial upload resume capability
- Skip already completed items
- Recovery from network interruptions
```

### 9. **Configuration Profiles**
```bash
# Multiple environment support
- Development/Staging/Production profiles
- Different credential sets per environment
- Environment-specific settings (bandwidth limits, schedules)
- Quick environment switching
```

### 10. **Batch Operations**
```bash
# Automation features
- Script-driven operations from CSV files
- Scheduled backups with cron integration
- Bulk operations across multiple projects
- Template-based restore configurations
```

## üé® **Visual & Usability Improvements**

### 11. **Enhanced Interface**
```bash
# Better visual design
- Status icons (üü¢ ‚úÖ ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ùå üìÅ üíæ)
- Color-coded output (green=success, red=error, yellow=warning)
- Tabular data with proper column alignment
- Loading spinners during API calls
```

### 12. **Smart Defaults & Suggestions**
```bash
# Intelligent assistance
- Suggest optimal settings based on VM size
- Recommend backup frequency based on usage
- Auto-detect related VMs (same project/cluster)
- Warn about potential issues before starting
```

### 13. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
```bash
# Power user features
- Ctrl+A (select all), Ctrl+C (clear), Ctrl+S (save)
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Enter to confirm, Esc to cancel
- Tab completion for VM names
```

## üîç **Monitoring & Analytics**

### 14. **Dashboard View**
```bash
# New script: backup_dashboard.sh
- Overview of all restore points
- Storage usage trends over time
- Backup success rates and failure analysis
- VM backup coverage (which VMs aren't backed up)
```

### 15. **Notifications & Alerts**
```bash
# Communication features
- Email notifications for completed operations
- Slack/Teams webhook integration
- Critical error alerts
- Weekly backup summary reports
```

### 16. **Audit Trail**
```bash
# Compliance and tracking
- Detailed operation logs with user attribution
- Backup/restore history per VM
- Compliance reporting (retention policies)
- Export audit logs to external systems
```

## üöÄ **Advanced Features**

### 17. **Web Interface**
```bash
# Modern UI option
- Simple web dashboard for non-technical users
- Drag-and-drop VM selection
- Mobile-responsive design
- Role-based access control
```

### 18. **API Integration**
```bash
# Automation enablement
- REST API for all operations
- Webhook support for external integrations
- CLI with JSON output for scripting
- Terraform provider integration
```

### 19. **Advanced Storage Options**
```bash
# Storage optimizations
- Compression during backup
- Deduplication across backups
- Cloud storage integration (S3, Azure, GCP)
- Backup encryption
```

### 20. **Intelligent Features**
```bash
# AI-powered enhancements
- Predictive failure detection
- Optimal backup scheduling suggestions
- Anomaly detection in backup patterns
- Automated cleanup recommendations
```
